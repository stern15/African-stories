<p id="p1"> <span>I</span>can’t believe the receptionist is not going to take my consultation fee just because I’m from her tribe! I thought corruption 
	    was only for the politicians and big businessmen. But here, in a small town clinic, I am going to be the beneficiary of a corrupt doctor’s 
	    receptionist. Is this a good thing or a bad thing? Well, I don’t care right now. I have spent the day running around offices getting papers 
	    stamped. Now, I have to get a doctor to give me a check-up, approve this medical form, and stamp it. I was about to walk out of this clinic 
	    because the consultation fee alone, without the medical check-up fee, was way too high. But then, the receptionist glimpsed my name on the form 
	    and said, “Eh, you mean you are from my village! Why didn’t you tell me your surname, I would have done you a favour.” Then she started 
	    chatting away in <em>our</em> language.<br/><br/>
	    “If you had told me where you were from, I wouldn’t have told you to pay that high consultation fee. In fact, I’ve got enough for today, so 
	    don’t bother paying for consultation. Just wait for the patient who is in now to come out and you can go in for your check-up.” Thank goodness
	    she sneaked those last sentences in English. She started rattling on in <em>our</em> language again. I dared not inform her that I didn’t 
	    understand a single word she was saying. Today, was not going to be the day I revealed my excuse for not knowing my mother tongue.<br/>
	    I will not reveal to her that I became aware of my vernacular deprivation in ‘93, when I was a child. Daddy had taken me to the classroom and 
	    left me there. I stopped sobbing when the teacher led me in. The room was so big! There were over a hundred children in there; at least seven 
	    pupils on each of the fifteen or so benches. The walls were dirty, and you could see where the blue paint had been chipped at by enthusiastic 
	    kids. There were no cupboards, no teacher’s desk, no carpet, no sleeping corner, no tiles. The room held only children, benches, a cemented 
	    floor and a huge, old blackboard positioned at the front. Everything was so dated. It was as if the decor had been inspired by an <em>Adams 
	    Family</em> episode. At the back of the classroom, bags were sprawled all over the floor, since there were not enough hooks on the wall to 
	    carry them all. I looked up at the man who I assumed was the class teacher, as I’d heard my daddy address him as Mr. Muhangazima, and asked,
	    “Where is the fridge?”</p>
	    
    <p> There were loud gasps and the class started laughing. I began to cry again. Mr. Muhangazima bent down and quietly said, “This is a classroom.  
	    We don’t keep fridges in classrooms. We don’t have a fridge in the school, except the one in the canteen. <em>Mpozi</em> there’s a new one in 
	    the kitchen –”<br/>
	    “But where will I keep my break time snacks?”<br/>
	    “Just leave them in your bag and then put it at the back of the classroom.”<br/>
	    He led me to the back and pulled one bag off a strong hook, hastily threw it to the ground, and put mine in its place.<br/>
	    I couldn’t understand my new surroundings. Back in Australia, my Grade 2 class – with just
        thirty-two pupils - was the biggest in the whole school. Each class had a fridge to keep snacks until break time and a microwave to warm them 
        if necessary. My Australian class had a carpet for story time and tables for writing at and red and blue building blocks for doing algebra. We 
        also had a painting corner, an ‘imaginary’ corner, and a sleeping corner for taking afternoon naps. And we could wear anything we wanted. Not 
        like this school, where I had to wear white socks pulled up to my knees and a green and white checked dress that looked exactly like the ones 
        mummy used to wear when she was pregnant with my younger brother - except mine had a belt. Such a strange uniform!</p>
        
    <p> Mr. Muhangazima took me to a bench at the back of the classroom. There were five pupils seated at it.</p>
    
    <p> “Daisy is a good girl” he said as he beckoned me into a seat next to a thin lipped girl, “she will make friends with you.” He walked away 
	    chuckling as though it was hard for him to suppress his laughter. As soon as I sat and said “hello”, Daisy pulled away from me and in doing so 
	    almost pushed the others off the bench. She looked down at her book and continued doing the math exercises that Mr. Muhangazima had left on the 
	    board. I had never have to add fifteen to twelve without using building blocks, so I could not understand a thing. I didn’t want to be laughed 
	    at again, so I didn’t ask for them. Every time I tried to ask Daisy to explain, she inched further and further away from me. It was as if she 
	    was blocking me. There was some barrier I could not penetrate.</p>
	    
	<p> Barriers. My attention was brought back to the receptionist’s incessant rambling. Somewhere in between, I figured out she had offered me a seat 
		in the waiting area right in front of her desk. It’s 2011 and I still feel like there are barriers I cannot penetrate, like this one. What on 
		earth is she saying to me? It’s been 18 years and I still feel like that girl my classmates were inching away from. I can’t break into certain 
		social circles because of this barrier. Either I’m trying to break into people’s lives, but they shrink from me because they don’t understand 
		me or I’m avoiding people because I’m too ashamed to reveal that I don’t understand them. I wish I could hide from the receptionist right now. 
		What if she figures out that I can’t speak <em>our</em> language? Will she still think of me as a village mate or will she feel taken advantage 
		of and withdraw her no-consultation-fee offer? I’ve encountered so many barriers; age barriers, education barriers, gender barriers, but none 
		has made me feel as alienated as the language barrier. Anyone can understand a woman fighting for her rights, but few comprehend how one can 
		fail to learn their own language. Thank goodness more patients have walked in! Now the receptionist is preoccupied with explaining to them the 
		high consultation fee prices. One patient has a Kenyan accent. Lucky her. Everyone can understand why she can’t speak any Ugandan languages. 
		Perhaps next time I walk into a place I should speak with a foreign accent so that people can immediately address me in English. Urgh!! That 
		thought reminds me again of that first day in school.</p>
		
	<p> After that episode with Daisy, it was time for social sciences. The teacher was skinny and tall. She walked to the front of the class and 
		crooned, “Good morning P.3 K.”<br/>
		“Good morning, Miss Nakanwagi!” Everyone stood up to greet her.<br/>
		“Good. Sit down. Where is the new girl?”<br/>
		Everyone turned and looked me.<br/>
		“Eh, they have not yet cut your hair? Did the headmaster give you permission to keep your hair 
		long?”</p>	
		
	<p> I hadn’t noticed that none of the girls had hair on their heads. Before I had time to think about it,
		the teacher had sent a boy from the front of the class to the back and told me to take his place. At the front, I felt as if people’s stares
		were piercing my back. Halfway through the lesson, I began to feel stupid because I couldn’t answer any questions. She was asking about Muntu
		and Sera - the first humans on earth and then moved on to some tale, mentioning Gipiir and Labong. Then she asked the shape of the world.
		Finally! I shot my hand up - I definitely knew the answer this one!</p>
		
	<p> “Yes new girl. Stand up and give us the answer.”<br/> 
		“It’s a circle.” I shouted, beaming.<br/>
        The class burst out laughing.</p>
        
    <p> “Repeat!” The teacher made me repeat my answer until my new classmates started mimicking my accent. I sat down, depressed. Everyone was 
	    laughing at me.<br/>
	    I was so relieved when it was time for break. I wished I could have hidden somewhere in the school and not return for another class! Before 
	    walking off to eat, I went to thank the teachers for their classes. They were sitting at their table on the classroom verandah. My thanking 
	    them sparked off some kind of debate.</p>
	    
	<p> “Eh <em>bambi</em>, the girl is from outside countries but she is still well-mannered,” said one of the teachers.<br/>
		“You mean people from <em>bulaaya</em> have bad manners?” Mr. Muhangazima always seemed kind and supportive when he spoke.<br/>
		“<em>Nanti</em> they are always proud and spoilt when they come back, but this one <em>bambi</em> even thanks us for teaching?”<br/>
		“<em>Wamma</em> go and have your break before the bell rings.”<br/>
		
	<p> When I turned round to look for a place to sit, I wished I could have stayed with Mr. Muhangazima instead, because all the children were 
		avoiding me. The school was so big. The road from the main gate led up to a roundabout. On the left side of the road was the lower primary 
		section, made of primary one and two (referred to as P.1 and P.2). The rest of the school was on the right side of the road. This included the 
		school kitchen, administrative offices, main hall and staff room. Each class had five streams; N, P, S, K and U, derived from N-akasero P-
		rimary S-chool K-ampala U-ganda. When daddy and I had reported to the headmaster’s office that morning, the headmaster asked which colour I 
		liked best among yellow, blue, red, green and white. “Green”, I had said, because I was in green house in my school in Australia. So he 
		allocated me to P.3K because all the K classes were in the green building of Eland house. Whoever designed the school was very organized, 
		because each block of classes had five classrooms for the five streams. And the classes were huge; accommodating over a hundred pupils per 
		stream. The P.3 and P.4 blocks were separated by a big, grassy, fenced compound. I sat on a step on the verandah of my P.3 block, near the 
		teacher’s table. I began to eat the bread and cake mummy had packed for me. Then Daisy came up to me with another boy and asked, “<em>Wamma</
		em> did you used to talk to Eddie Murphy?”</em></p>
		
	<p> “Who is Eddie Murphy?” I responded.<br/>
		“The one who acted in Coming to America.”<br/>
		“I don’t know Eddie Murphy. I came from Australia, not America”<br/>
		“This boy said that your father is a black American! He saw your dad bringing you, he even heard
		him talking like from America.”<br/>
		“No. My father is Ugandan, but we used to live in Australia.”</p>
		
	<p> “You see I told you!” she said to the boy and they walked off arguing. Then break time was done. The English teacher was awful. She started
		with my bench which was at the front. I couldn’t open
		my book with the homework she wanted, because since it was my first day at a Ugandan school; I didn’t have any homework completed. I didn’t
		want her to get to me because I hated the way she was screaming insults about everyone’s work. But I didn’t have enough time to nurture my fear
		because I was the fourth person in the row, “Where is your homework?” She asked.</p>
		
	<p> “I’m -”<br/>
		“Don’t tell me your nonsense!! Where is your homework?”<br/>
		Before I could answer, her hand slap me hard across my face.<br/>
		“Didn’t you hear me telling people to open their homework on the bench –”<br/>
		The multiple shouts from the class telling her that I was a new pupil silenced her.<br/>
		“Eh, sorry.” And she walked on, just like that, screaming at the next person in her broken English.</p>
		
	<p> I had never been slapped before, except by my mummy. I had tried to be superman and flew off the top of a cupboard and sprained my knee and 
		pretended to be dead. She was so scared and angry and happy at the same time, so that when I came to all she could do was slap me for giving 
		her such a fright. But why would a teacher beat a student? In Australia, a teacher hit a child once in my nursery school and was arrested. No 
		one is allowed to beat children there, except their parents or guardians, and even then, there were restrictions on how much a parent could 
		beat their own child.Beating. It is strange how I have gotten so used to it over the years. I am not even perturbed by the sound of policemen 
		beating idlers on Bombo road just outside this building. The clinic is on the fourth floor where the tear gas doesn’t seem to have had as much 
		effect. The receptionist finished with the other patients and turned back to me. By her gestures I could tell she was saying something about 
		the ongoing riots. Ever since Muammar Gaddafi died, the opposition thinks it can overthrow our president too. So every Monday they hold ‘Walk 
		to Work’ demonstrations. All opposition party members and parliamentarians walk to their offices. Idlers and workers in town stand by the
		roadsides to cheer them on or join them, so every Monday morning the police and army roam about in ‘mambas’ spraying tear gas and pink water at 
		the crowds, then the shops close for a few hours to prevent theft, until the protestors are arrested and released on bail, then the businessmen 
		put on a demonstration because the ‘Walk to Work’ campaign disrupts their profit-making, then the university students hold a strike because the 
		lecturers use the campaign to extend their weekends. This cycle has continued for months, such that medical workers, teachers and lawyers have 
		also taken turns going on strike. I would like to use the routine to stay safe at home, but this week is my deadline for sending the papers.
		</p>
		
	<p> This morning I took a taxi before the sun rose (and before the protestors started walking to work). I wisely spent the morning going to offices 
		further from the town center where there wasn’t much commotion. In the afternoon, I had to brave the remaining disturbances to visit the 
		offices in town. I hid in the crowded toilets of the commercial buildings and turned on a tap to wash tear gas out of my eyes. Everyone was in 
		their offices because they couldn’t go out into the smoky streets, so I got everything else signed and stamped, except my medical forms. There 
		was no way I was going to get through to the taxi park to go to my family’s clinic. Well, at least not until the evening when everyone would 
		stop rioting and go home. So I stopped at the first signposted town clinic and entered into the safest-looking building. And here I am now, 
		staring at the receptionist’s blabbering mouth. Our pseudo-conversation was interrupted by a small crowd rushing a bleeding child into the 
		reception. I couldn’t tell if the blood was coming from the child’s forehead or eye. Either way, the blood managed to mingle with mucus from 
		the nose and so was smeared all over the left side of the child’s face. The mother was wailing. She looked more terrified than the injured 
		little girl who was sobbing quietly. The girl must have been about eight years old. As they whisked her into the emergency room, I thought the 
		receptionist would finally be silenced by the horrific scene. I was wrong. It gave her a lot more to blabber about. I think she started talking 
		about things that make women and girls cry. I hate seeing crying girls. They remind me of that unforgettable first day.</p>
		
	<p> I sobbed and cried quietly throughout the English lesson that day. The teacher made me think of the stories of Amin that I had heard. Daddy 
		said the reason we came back to Uganda was because President Amin was no longer president. H. E. Museveni had restored peace, and so we didn’t 
		have to be in exile anymore. If it wasn’t for Amin, maybe I wouldn’t be feeling like an outcast in my country and new school. My big sisters 
		wanted to stay in Sidney for a few more years, but daddy said when death came his way; it should find him in his own country. He had spent the 
		last two years sending money back to Uganda in order to build a home for us. Also, since he was a vice- principal of a teacher’s training 
		college in Australia, Makerere University offered him a big job that he couldn’t turn down. I thought I would find peace in Uganda like he 
		said, but instead, the English teacher had just slapped me. I tried hard not to pee in my pants in terror of it all. I resolved never to come 
		back to school again. But then, as soon as the teacher ended her class, the children sitting around me started saying sorry and offering me 
		sweets and telling me how I’d get used to the beatings and all. Suddenly, I was making friends. The children were no longer scared of talking 
		to me. This began my orientation into my country, Uganda.</p>
		
	<p> Uganda was horrible at first! When we arrived, three weeks before my initiation into Ugandan school days, we did not have electricity for two 
		days in a row. After that, electricity was off every other night. There were only two TV stations; UTV and CTV. Between those two stations, 
		there were only five cartoons; <em>Pingu, Superbook, Kissyfur, Duck Tales</em> and <em>Didi</em>. Well <em>Didi</em> wasn’t a cartoon, but he 
		was just as fun to watch since he was a clown. In Australia, power only went off once or twice a year, and the dates of the power cuts were 
		announced at least six months before the blackout. And there were two whole channels dedicated to cartoons all day and night. Here, the 
		cartoons only came on during the weekdays in the evenings, so I spent my weekends learning how to play <em>kwepena</em> (dodgeball) and 
		<em>dool</em> (shooting marbles) with my neighbours. I have learnt a lot since then, over the years. I have learnt to kneel when greeting 
		elders and to peel and steam <em>matooke</em> in its banana leaves. I have learnt to iron clothes with a charcoal iron when there is no power, 
		and to cook with firewood. I learnt to wear three pairs of shorts under my school uniform so that it didn’t hurt as much when I was caned by 
		teachers. I learnt enough Luganda to bargain for things in Owino market, and how to make <em>kwepena</em> balls out of any piece of soft 
		rubbish in the compound. I no longer have an Australian accent. My friends learnt a lot too. They learnt the difference between Australia and
		America. They learnt that not every Ugandan abroad is cleaning toilets and bedpans in hospitals. They learnt that not every child from abroad 
		is a spoilt brat who can’t climb trees; in fact, children from <em>bulaaya</em> can be very generous with their fancy toys! They learnt that it 
		is futile to speak vernacular to someone who spent the first nine years of their life speaking English in a foreign continent. In fact, had it 
		not been for the numerous relatives that camped at our spacious home for years after we got back, I probably wouldn’t even be able to speak the 
		little Luganda I do now. And we speak Luganda, not because it is our language, but because daddy’s new job is in the country’s capital - 
		Bugandaland. Everyone from every other tribe in the country learns to speak Luganda when they live here. Most of them know their own languages 
		too. But a few, like me, who only visit our villages once or twice a year, will forever suffer this minor identity crisis and those quizzical 
		looks we get every time someone declares, “You can’t speak your language!”</p>
		
	<p> But today, I am not going get that look. I am going to let the receptionist blabber on in <em>our</em> mother tongue, and I’ll keep nodding and 
		laughing and exclaiming at appropriate intervals, because that is my ticket to getting into the doctor’s room without paying that expensive 
		consultation fee. Then he’ll fill in my medical form, stamp it, and I’ll get out and say bye to the receptionist in Luganda or English. Then 
		she’ll say bye to me in Luganda or English and she won’t find it weird because everyone in Kampala speaks Luganda or English. Then I’ll get out 
		and add my medical form to my other papers which I will submit to the embassy. Then they will call me after a few days to let me know if I’ve 
		been approved for a visa to fly out of my country to do my masters degree in Australia.</p>
