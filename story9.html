		<h1>WAITING</h1><hr/>
		
		<h3>Hellen Nyana</h3><br/></br></br></br>
		
<p id="p1"> <span>T</span>he chick in the purple top, high waist skirt and kitten heels definitely knows how to dress in an understated yet alluring 
	    sort of way. Not a hair out of place - I had to stop and stare to make sure there really wasn’t a hair out of place - subtle make-up and clean, 
	    short, fingernails. The fastened buttons of her button-down shirt stop slightly above her bosom, giving me an ever so slight peep as she heaves 
	    in subtle anticipation. She is a snob though. Earlier on, when I tried to greet her and introduce myself, she had politely answered, but had 
	    deliberately refused to give me her name, walking off instead and sitting at the other end of the table where she pretends to read a book. No 
	    one can convince me they can concentrate on a book while they wait for a life-altering experience so she has to be pretending. Then there is 
	    the breast-feeding chick. Not that she has come with a child to the job interview, but the tight knot around her chest attracts even more 
	    attention to the already lifted boobs, thanks to an obviously effective push-up bra. She keeps checking herself in her pocket mirror and adding 
	    layers and layers of grease to her lips. She might be bored, like all of us are in the waiting room but she definitely intends to rely heavily 
	    on her “bosom buddies” to nail the job. Those boobs better do a good job today or I would hate to think what she will do to them if they fail 
	    her, I think to myself. I turn to my HTC and update my twitter status to: <em>Had I known boobs played a big role in getting a job, I would 
	    have been born a woman. #WinningNot</em></p>  
	    
    <p> The waiting room is down a long corridor, next to a conference hall with a big wooden door in which the written and oral interviews are to 
		take place. The room is portioned off with a glass screen and a sliding door. The glass has patterns on it, such that the people on the inside   
		and those on the outside can see figures on either side without making out the faces. It is furnished quite tastefully with black sofas and a 
		glass-top table in the room’s centre, topped with business magazines and profile pamphlets on the organisation conducting the interviews - the 
		Ministry. Six of us have just been herded into the room from the reception. We mumble greetings to the people who are next to us in the line 
		and attempt to look for comfortable spots in the room which can easily fit twenty people. I take the seat nearest to the entrance just in case 
		I need to dash out, and also it can’t hurt to see all the people that want the job.</p>
		
	<p> The profile pamphlets are the first to be picked up and like hot, meaty bites at a cocktail party, they go fast. One must know everything they 
		can about the company they want to work for, I guess. I pick one from the last two and begin to leaf through.</p>
		
	<p> My reading is interrupted when a short, old man in an oversized coat sweeps into the room. He says in a firm and loud voice, “Good morning 
		everybody. How are you all today?” We all mumble unintelligible things, some of us startled out of our private worlds by his commanding 
		presence. Due to his air of authority, if I had not seen him before at the written interview we had in Namboole, I would have thought he 
		already worked for the Ministry and had come to instruct us in the next step of the selection process. He goes ahead and pumps some hands, 
		sprinkling more pleasantries as he jumps over people to reach those seated on the other side of the table. They have already warmed up their 
		seats and refuse to leave their strategic vantage points. He finds a seat on the other side of the table which is directly opposite the 
		entrance and proceeds to pull out a bunch of papers and starts going over them with furious concentration, as if preparing for a final exam. 
		From the unnaturally black edges on his scalp, you can tell he has recently dyed his hair. Dude, you should have cut off that beard completely  
		because those grey hairs are not helping in your mission to look young, I mentally chastise the short, old man in an oversized coat.</p>
		
	<p> When he looks up from his papers, he seems to recognise the chick that has come in after him and has chosen to sit next to me. Through their 
		conversation later, I find out her name is Lydia. She takes a seat and goes through the newspaper she carried in with her. She mumbles comments 
		about the day’s headlines and makes fun of a photograph showing a smiling bank executive handing toys to a malnourished child. The emaciated 
		body had made the front page the previous week.<br/>
		“Corporate Social Responsibility, my foot!” she grumbles.</p>
		
	<p>	She looks up, her gaze meeting the short, old man in an oversized coat who has now moved from his seat.</p>
	
	<p> “You made it to this round I see,” he says while enthusiastically shaking her hand and looking around as if to make sure the rest of us have 
		heard.<br/>
		“So did you,” she says smiling, “How have you been, Mzee? We should stop meeting like this,” she adds removing her bag from the next 
		seat and offering it to him instead.<br/>
		He sits down next to her and the two start to catch up. From their conversation, I can tell they have met 
		several times in different companies, always being interviewed for one job or another.<br/>
		“No. We didn’t stand a chance at that Parliament job. Did 
		you see the pile of letters where our application letters were thrown?” He asks rhetorically. “I bet if we tried to find out who the current 
		editor of the Hansard is, it is definitely someone who already knew someone there,” he adds with a defeated shrug.</p>
		
	<p> The old man goes into a tirade about how he would have given up the whole job search had it not been for the children he has to put through 
		school. What is turning into a pity party is broken up when one of the interviewers enters and announces that the next interview is due soon 
		and we need to move to the conference room next door. Two other people stand at the door panting and checking their watches. Written all over 
		their faces is the relief that they’ve managed to make it to the next round. We shuffle to the next room, take our seats and get ready for our 
		second written interview.</p>
		
	<p>	<em>“There has been a natural disaster in one of the rural constituents which has claimed ten lives and left hundreds of families displaced. 
		Write a speech for the Minister of Disaster Preparedness which he will deliver when he goes to sympathise with the survivors”.</em></p>
		
	<p> That is our first question.<br/>
        This question, instead of arousing panic or excitement, reminds me of my father. He always says I’m good with words and it is because of him I 
        am here. The first time he told me to get in touch with his friend at the Ministry for a communications officer’s job, I said no straight out. 
        I had just come back from one of the best technology universities in Malaysia where I did a Bachelor of Arts in games art development and I 
        wasn’t going to waste my time being whatever my father suggested. People always frowned at the kind of course I did, many questioning its 
        marketability in a third world country, but how are we going to become less third world, if we don’t introduce some of the things we see and 
        learned in the first world? And why can’t third world students study subjects they are passionate about, instead of what their country’s 
        limited job markets force them to do?</p>
        
    <p> I clearly remember the day my passion for video games started. I was six years old and my father had just returned from a trip abroad and he 
	    presented me with a <em>Super Mario Bros </em> game. He had planned to get me a toy car, but when he saw his American friend pick up the grey, 
	    rectangular cartridge for his son at the store, he decided to get the game for me instead. He did not know how to operate it so I had to teach 
	    myself, my mother swears they did not see me for a week. I could never refute that accusation considering that video game became my best friend 
	    and incited my passionate love affair with video games. Every time my father went on a trip I asked that he bring me not the trendiest clothes, 
	    but the latest video games. <em>The Legend of Zelda, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles </em> and<em> Dragon Warrior </em>saw me through my 
	    tumultuous teenage years, when I escaped into them, trying to get over my crush on Crystal - our next door neighbour or when I wanted to 
	    impress Bella - the first girl who came over our house to visit when I was 17. Later I graduated to<em> Assassin’s  Creed, Black OPs, 
	    Battlefield 3 Online </em>and<em> Modern Warfare 3 </em>and my love for gaming was pretty much sealed.</p>
	    
	<p> Over the years, I met people with similar interests and while in Malaysia, I decided to do a course so I could set up the first gaming arcade 
		in the country when I returned. Every day I dreamt of having that arcade and doing something I loved. My father, like with most of the 
		suggestions I presented to him, laughed off the idea. He said it would never work, although he still continued to pay my school fees and made 
		sure I was more than comfortable as a foreign student. He must have hoped I would get over the idea by the time I graduated. He never ceased to 
		mention how good I was at communicating and how he was always impressed by poems I had written. I always enjoyed watching him fidget when his 
		friends asked what I did in school. He became adept at steering the conversation towards himself, he would say “some sort of engineering but he 
		writes well too” so as to prevent me from revealing my desired vocation.</p>
		
	<p> He told me about the communications officer vacancy, even before it was advertised in the papers. This was no surprise. He must have told his
		friends I was coming home and he needed work for his son. When I said no, he gave me a long lecture about how he had indulged my childish 
		choices for long enough, “It’s about time you became realistic and looked for a job that is actually available on the market” he told me. I 
		argued that the reason they’d sent us out to acquire knowledge was so we could learn new ideas and introduce them into our own country and make 
		it a better place. </p>
		
	<p> I tried desperately to convince him, “There is no doubt that I would make it work. I have done all the research about what I need and if you 
		invest in me I will have paid you back with interest in the first six months.”</p>
		
	<p> This did not go down well with my father though, “Listen young man” he told me “you have already wasted enough of my money and I will 
		definitely not spend another dime on your wishful thinking on games and what not.” A vein popped up in the middle of his forehead, like it 
		always did when he was determined to win an argument.</p>
		
	<p> Unfortunately, while abroad and generously provided for, it had never crossed my mind to save some of the money my father had been sending me. 
		I had never faced any resistance from him concerning most of the things I told him about, so I always believed he would be interested in 
		investing in the arcade.</p>
	
	<p> Days later, I received a call, a woman was on the other end and she informed me of an upcoming written interview for a job at Namboole which I 
		was expected to attend – even though I had not applied for it.</p>
	
	<p> So this was how on a hot Wednesday morning I had ended up in Namboole stadium competing with about hundred people for one job. We were all 
		smartly dressed in our most impressive clothes, for some they were probably wearing their suits for the first time or in their first pair of 
		heels. We were tested on our knowledge of press releases and public relation strategies and I must have done well because here I am again, 
		sitting for another written interview with ten other people.</p>
		
	<p> After the interview, they ask us to wait around but I decide to take a walk around the offices instead. I cannot stand that waiting room 
		anymore. The air conditioning alone makes the room too cold and none of us can tell who actually wants it on or whether it can be switched off. 
		After wandering around for a bit, I go to use the gents to wash my face. I am always fascinated with the notices put up in washrooms. I believe 
		you can tell a lot about an establishment from them. On the walls, this particular one has: IF YOU SPRINKLE WHEN YOU TINKLE, PLEASE BE A 
		SWEETIE AND WIPE THE SEATIE. If worst came to the worst and I ended up here, (which I doubt I will considering the little effort I put in the 
		interview that I’ve just finished), at least the people here seem to have a good sense of humour - or the person who wrote it had been a 
		kindergarten teacher at some point, in which case I could not be bothered. Once I had mistakenly ended up in the ladies’ washroom. If I’m 
		completely honest, it wasn’t a mistake really; the gents had no toilet paper so after looking around and making sure was there no one in the 
		ladies’, I went there to get some. An unsuspecting woman caught me reading a notice that said: BE CONSIDERATE OF THE PEOPLE WHO USE THIS PLACE 
		AFTER YOU. IMAGINE HOW YOU WOULD LIKE TO FIND THIS PLACE AND DO THE SAME. ALSO, DO NOT FLUSH SANITARY TOWELS. RAP THEM NICELY AND PLACE THEM IN 
		THE BUCKET. The women in that establishment obviously needed a long lecture on hygiene and correct spellings.</p>
		
	<p> Back in the waiting room, I’m told that four of us have been asked to stay for an oral interview. The chick in the purple top, Lydia, myself 
		and some other dude who came in right before we went in for the written interview. The rest have been asked to kindly collect a soda or water 
		from the reception and were thanked for their time. The short, old man in an oversized coat is sticking around talking to Lydia and like a 
		father at his daughter’s sports’ day, taking her through some of the questions she may be asked.</p>
		
	<p> The latecomer goes in first and comes out looking more stressed than he did an hour ago. We lean in conspiratorially to hear his verdict of the 
		panel.<br/>
		“They are pretty friendly except for the man in the middle who kept asking me more questions before I could give my answers. Such a bully!” he
		says exasperated.<br/>
        Lydia is called in and we wish her the very best. After hearing the other guy’s verdict we’re friendlier to each other, having seen how the 
        other people with whom we begun the day have been dismissed without a care. We saw their worried faces and their tired, defeated shrugs. We 
        have survived and somehow this had brought us closer and made us more comfortable with each other. Finally someone complains about the air 
        conditioning and I move to put it at a more bearable temperature.</p>
        
    <p> “How are you even supposed to gauge the amount of money you want them to pay you without underselling yourself? We should have agreed on the 
	    salary we all want,” the other guy says obviously regretting whatever amount he said while in there. We all deliberately ignore the salary 
	    question. Yes we are friends now, but we are not going to blurt out what we think we’re worth.
	    Lydia walks out and we listen for our names in anticipation.<br/>
	    “Can we have Florence next,” says the lady responsible for the summoning. The chick in the purple top stands and marches to the conference
	    room.<br/>
	    Lydia says she does not want to talk about it. Minutes later she seems to change her mind and says rather angrily, “It’s horrible in there. You
	    would think after doing it so many times I would be used to it!”</p> 
	    
	<p> When Florence comes back to the waiting room, she sits down cautiously, like someone with a sore body. With a blank stare she says in an 
		unsteady voice, “One of my current bosses is on the panel.” </p>
		
	<p> We gasp and can offer no words of comfort.<br/>
		“I do not remember anything I said after I saw him. I called in sick this morning so I could get the
		day off. I guess they needed someone with a journalistic background to judge our work,” she says fighting back tears.<br/>
		For the first time I think of the short, old man’s children, the breast-feeding chick’s effort to get ahead and Florence who is now
		apprehensively biting her nails. I do not know whether this is what they have always wanted to do, but they are fighting for it. I had been on
		panels like these before. When presenting my first game concept at university and presenting even more ideas in competitions held in different
		universities internationally. The key was to believe in what you were selling and to never falter in what you believed. That was my belief
		anyway. And I must have subconsciously given off that vibe to the panel, because to my father’s delight and my deepest despair, I receive a
		phone call a week later confirming that I am the new communications officer at his friend’s office.</p>
