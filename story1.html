		<h1>THAT SAME NIGHT</h1><hr/>
		
		<h3>Elone N. Ainebyoona</h3><br/></br></br></br>
		
<p id="p1"> <span>T</span>hat same night,<br/>
            He picked me along the way.<br/>
            He charmed me with his bundles.<br/>
            He assured me of pleasure each day.<br/> 
            He took me around his castles.<br/>
            He asked me to stay.</p>	
           	
        <p> That same night,<br/>
            I forgot about my pimples.<br/>
            I only felt gay.<br/>
            I could only feel my dimples.<br/>
            I looked forward to his nightly play.</p>
           
        <p> That same night,<br/>
            His body moved like ripples.<br/>
            His hands felt softer than clay.<br/> 
            His smooch gave me tickles.<br/>
            His form warmer than an overlay.<p>  
	           
	    <p> That same night,<br/>
            He began to sway.<br/>
            He curved in like a sickle.<br/> 
            He shoved me away.<br/>
            He chased me like trouble.<br/> 
            He denied me my pay,<br/>
            He only gave me prickles.</p> 
           
        <p> That same night<br/>
            I couldnâ€™t believe the betray,<br/> 
            I left in hustles.<br/>
            I rushed for the subway.<br/>
            I was all left a ramshackle,<br/>
            I only had to pray.<br/>
            I dreaded that one night.</p>
