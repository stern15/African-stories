		<h1>EYE OF POETRY</h1><hr/>
		
		<h3>Lilian A. Aujo</h3><br/></br></br></br>
		
<p id="p1"> <span>P</span>oetry is the school I will never graduate from<br/>
            because no matter how hard – I try<br/>             
            I will never tell it all – the secret way of its patterns<br/> 
            And how the same letters form different syllables to form different words,<br/> 
            And how they fall – in front or behind one another, and if re-arranged would create a whole<br/>
            different story...<br/>
            It is how emotions run<br/>
            High – Low – Calm – Serene<br/>
            Vivacious, like the sun at noon, surreal like the fantasy it promises<br/>
            You never know when poetry goes subtle or quiet. How even when there,<br/>
            It grows deep like a river that bleeds<br/>
            when the dry earth has sucked out her waters...poetry...</p>
            
            
        <p> It is the bird song I cannot articulate<br/>
            The trickle of the tap in a porcelain sink<br/>
            The whoosh of the wind that makes my skin stand on end<br/>
            That thing that knocks the breath out of my lungs<br/>
            The music in you, unsung, yet so fervent you tingle within<br/>
            The notes in the air unwritten on sheets. Tangible, intangible, whatever you please</p>
            
            
        <p> It is useless to try to fathom how,<br/>
            Without seeming to say much, it says so much,<br/>
            How it clings to you like the little hand of a small child begging you to stay<br/> 
            Or, like the sticky filmy strands of the spider<br/>                                                
            whose web you never see – but, You walk right into anyway...</p>
            
            
        <p> It is the sweet tangle between fantasy and realism<br/>
            And metaphysics and apathy and breath and death<br/>
            But do not worry if the opposites don’t quite match or get criss-crossed right:<br/>
            The rhythms do not always match...<br/>
            see, there in disorder exists the same beauty eminent in order,<br/>
            I have come to learn,<br/>
            That free verse, sonnet, haiku, list, and lyrical when tweaked just right<br/>
            Are like a violin in the hands of a skilled violinist: so many songs from the tip of one bow</p>
            
            
        <p> I live, breathe, dream poetry, in syllables so sweet they tantalise my mind<br/>
            Tie and untie my tongue so I have no choice but try to tell of its complexity,<br/>
            Of all the stories that are spun like the silky strands of Ananse’s tales<br/>
            And the flighty cunning of a hare’s escapades...<br/>
            I laugh so hard tears kiss the corners of my eyes,<br/>
            I learn lessons that might have remained unlearnt had they been in plain black or white</p> 
            
            
        <p> See, the twists are new with every turn<br/>
            Like a child’s wheel let loose and thrashing through bushes<br/>
            Like heavy raindrops never knowing their mark –<br/>
            Like the water in a lake that flows in itself and never knows where it ends and or where it begins...<br/> 
            yes it is that meld...</p>
            
        <p> ...the sublime, the divine...that you never touch<br/>
            Yet you know how it feels...<br/>
            It is the beauty you want to explain but words are always inept to describe<br/> 
            It is poetry...existent in as many exquisite and intrinsic patterns<br/>
            As there are on a peacock’s tail:</p>
            
            
        <p> While she sits, her iridescent plumage dazzles us,<br/>
            And when she fans her tail, we see her eye...<br/>
            <em>Hypnotically beautiful...spiralling into the magical chasm of poetry...<br/> 
            Do you see the eye of poetry?</em> </p>
